## Summary

Azure storage publishes [guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/premium-storage-performance)
for the applications to configure the disks' guest OS settings to drive maximum IOPS and Bandwidth.

Azure Disk CSI driver v2 allows customers to tweak the guest OS device settings using perfProfile feature.
Users can chose from a list of `perfProfile` to tweak the IO behavior of their block devices in accordance with their workloads.

`perfProfile` can be set at the `StorageClass` level and applies to all the disks created using the `StorageClass`

## Perf Profiles

Today user can chose from `None`, `Basic` and `Advanced` `perfProfile`.

If no `perfProfile` is specified in the `StorageClass`, `perfProfile` defaults to `None`. Which means there will be no optimizations done for PVs created using this `StorageClass`.

### Basic

`Basic` `perfProfile` offers a hands free option to tune the device settings for a balanced throughput and TPS workloads.

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: sc-kubestone-perf-optimized-premium-ssd-csi
provisioner: disk.csi.azure.com
parameters:
  skuName: Premium_LRS
  perfProfile: Basic # available values: "None" (default) and "Basic". The V2 driver adds "Advanced". These values are case insensitive.
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```

### Advanced

> Available with v2.0.0-alpha.1+

`Advanced` `perfProfile` gives users the ultimate flexibility to tweak any device setting they desire, to optimize the disk IOs for their workload.

Device settings can be tweaked by providing overrides in the `parameters` section of the `StorageClass`, using a prefix `device-setting/`.

If `perfProfile` is set to `Advanced`, driver treats any parameter which starts with prefix `device-setting/` as a device setting override.

Device setting overrides can be provided in format `<deviceSettingPrefix><deviceSetting>: "<deviceSettingValue>"`.

A valid device setting override starts with `device-setting/` and the `deviceSetting` has to be a valid block device setting in the kernel used. Relative paths to the device setting are not allowed.

For example:

To set `deviceSetting` /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler (here, /sys/block/sda is an example block device) to `mq-deadline`, user should use below override in `parameters` section if `StorageClass`. Below is a valid device setting override.

```yaml
  device-setting/queue/scheduler: "mq-deadline"
```

There are no limitations to how many settings user can tweak using this `perfProfile`.

If `perfProfile` is set to `Advanced`, at least one device setting override should be provided in the `parameters`.

In case, no device setting override is provided and the `perfProfile` is set to `Advanced`, CSI driver will fail any disk created using this `StorageClass`.

Any incorrect `deviceSetting` overrides provided in the `parameters` section will result in failure of disk staging on the node and will result in pod scheduling failure.

Here's an examples of an invalid device setting override. This override is invalid because `deviceSetting` uses a relative path (`..`). This will result in disk staging failure and cause the pod to be stuck.

```yaml
  device-setting/../queue/scheduler: "mq-deadline"
```

Users should be careful about using advanced `perfProfile` and make sure they test all the `deviceSetting` overrides in linux kernel they plan to use.

Here's an example of a `StorageClass` which tweaks some well known block device settings on linux.

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: sc-kubestone-perf-optimized-premium-ssd-csi
provisioner: disk.csi.azure.com
parameters:
  skuName: Premium_LRS
  perfProfile: Advanced # available values: None(by default), Basic, Advanced. These are case insensitive.
  device-setting/queue/max_sectors_kb: "52"
  device-setting/queue/scheduler: "mq-deadline"
  device-setting/iosched/fifo_batch: "1"
  device-setting/iosched/writes_starved: "1"
  device-setting/device/queue_depth: "16"
  device-setting/queue/nr_requests: "16"
  device-setting/queue/read_ahead_kb: "8"
  device-setting/queue/wbt_lat_usec: "0"
  device-setting/queue/rotational: "0"
  device-setting/queue/nomerges: "0"
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```

## Example

Consider `StorageClass` `sc-test-postgresql-p20-optimized` in below example, which can optimize a p20 azure disk to get increased combined throughput, IOPS and better IO latency for a PostresSQL inspired fio workload.

To try the optimizations, follow below step:

- Create an aks cluster with `Standard_D4s_v4` VM SKU nodepool.

- Install azuredisk CSI driver v2 using instructions [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azuredisk-csi-driver/tree/main_v2/charts).

- Install kubestone.

```console
kustomize build github.com/xridge/kubestone/config/default?ref=v0.5.0 | sed "s/kubestone:latest/kubestone:v0.5.0/" | kubectl create -f -

kubectl create namespace kubestone
```

- To run fio workload with optimized disks

```console
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -

## Limitations

- This feature is not supported for HDD or UltraDisk right now.
- This feature only optimizes data disks (PVs). Local/temp disks on the VM are not optimized by this feature.
- The current implementation only optimizes the disks which use the storVsc linux disk driver.

## Caution

- This feature is currently in `alpha` and customers are advised to not use this feature in their production workloads.
- Device tuned using the `Basic` and `Advanced` `perfProfile` options can show variance in performance due to several factors including (but not limited to) disk size, VM SKU, disk caching mode, linux distribution and kernel version, workload type. Customers are advised to test the `perfProfile` they chose in the controlled environment to ascertain the performance benefits, before using them.
