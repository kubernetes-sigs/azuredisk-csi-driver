# Azure Disk CSI Driver V2

Azure Disk CSI Driver V2 improves scalability and reduces pod 
failover latency. It uses shared disks to provision attachment replicas on multiple cluster 
nodes and integrates with the pod scheduler to ensure a node with a attachment replica is 
chosen on pod failover.

## Architecture and Components

The diagram below shows the components in the Kubernetes control plane (CCP) and cluster 
nodes, and the Azure services the Azure Disk CSI Driver V2 uses.

### Controller Plug-in

In addition to the CSI Controller API Server, this plug-in hosts several controllers for 
custom resources used to orchestrate persistent volume management and node placement.

The controller plug-in is deployed as a 
[ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) 
through [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) 
with leader election.

### Node Plug-in

In addition to the CSI Node API Server, this plug-in also provides feedback for pod placement 
used by the scheduler extender described below.

The node plug-in is deployed on each node in the cluster as a [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/).

### Scheduler Extender

Azure Disk CSI Driver V2 provides a [scheduler extender](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/scheduling/scheduler_extender.md) 
that is responsible for influencing pod placements.

Like the controller plug-in, the scheduler extender is deployed as a 
[ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) 
through [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) 
with leader election.

## Implementation

This section describes the changes and high-level implementation details of the different 
components in Azure Disk CSI Driver V2.

### StorageClass

In addition to the existing StorageClass parameters described in 
[driver-parameters](driver-parameters.md), Azure Disk CSI Driver V2 supports the following:

| Name                                        | Meaning                                         | Available Value                                        | Mandatory | Default value                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maxMountReplicaCount`                      | The number of replicas attachments to maintain. | This value must be in the range `[0..(maxShares - 1)]` | No        | If `accessMode` is `ReadWriteMany`, the default is `0`. Otherwise, the default is `maxShares - 1` |

### Custom Resources and Controllers

Azure Disk CSI Driver V2 uses 3 different custom resources defined in the `azure-disk-csi` namespace to 
orchestrate disk management and facilitate pod failover to nodes with attachment replica. A 
controller for each resource watches for and responds to changes to its custom resource 
instances.

#### `AzDriverNode` Resource and Controller

The `AzDriverNode` custom resource represents a node in the cluster where the Azure Disk CSI Driver V2 node 
plug-in runs. An instance of `AzDriverNode` is created when the node plug-in starts. The node 
plug-in periodically updates the heartbeat in the `Status` field.

The controller for `AzDriverNode` runs in the controller plug-in. It is responsible for 
deleting `AzDriverNode` instances that no longer have corresponding nodes in the cluster.

#### `AzVolume` Resource and Controller

The `AzVolume` custom resource represents the managed disk of a `PersistentVolume`. The 
controller for `AzVolume` runs in the controller plug-in. It watches for and reconciles 
changes in the `AzVolume` instances.

An `AzVolume` instance is created by the `CreateVolume` API to the CSI Controller plug-in. The 
`AzVolume` controller responds to the new instance by creating a managed disk using the 
parameters in the referenced `StorageClass`. When disk creation is complete, the controller 
sets the `.Status.State` field to `Created` or suitable error state on failure. It also adds a 
finalizer if creation was successful. The `CreateVolume` request completes when the `AzVolume` 
state is updated.

To delete a managed disk, the `DeleteVolume` API in the CSI Controller plug-in deletes the 
corresponding `AzVolume` instance. The controller responds to deletion by garbage collecting 
the managed disk. When the managed disk has been deleted, the controller removes the finalizer
from the `AzVolume` instance. The `DeleteVolume` request completes once the `AzVolume` instance
has been removed from the object store.

#### `AzVolumeAttachment` Resource and Controller

The `AzVolumeAttachment` custom resource represents the attachment of a managed disk to a 
specific node. The controller for this custom resource runs in the controller plug-in and 
watches for changes in the `AzVolumeAttachment` instances.

An `AzVolumeAttachment` instance representing the primary node attachment is created by the 
`ControllerPublishVolume` API in the CSI Controller plug-in. If an instance for the current 
node already exists, it is updated to represent the primary node attachment. The 
`AzVolumeAttachment` controller then attaches the manage disk to the primary node (downgrading 
to attachment replica or detaching any previous primary attachment if one exists). It then 
creates additional `AzVolumeAttachment` instances representing attachment replicas and attaches 
the shared manage disk to a number of backup nodes as specified by the `maxMountReplicaCount` 
parameter in the `StorageClass` instance of the `PersistentVolumeClaim` of the managed disk. 
The `ControllerPublishVolume` request is complete once the `AzVolumeAttachment` instance for 
primary node has been crerated. As each the attachment request completes, the controller sets 
the `.Status.State` field to `Attached` and adds a finalizer to each `AzVolumeAttachment` 
instance. When the `NodeStageVolume` API is called, the CSI Node plug-in will wait for the its
`AzVolumeAttachment` instance's state to reach `Attached` before staging the mount point to 
the disk.

When the `ControllerUnpublishVolume` API in the CSI Controller plug-in is called, it deletes 
the `AzVolumeAttachment` instance for the primary node. The controller responds by detaching 
the managed disk from the primary node. It removes the finalizer from the `AzVolumeAttachment`
instance when the detach operation completes. The `ControllerUnpublishVolume` request is 
complete when the detach operation has completed and corresponding `AzVolumeAttachment` has 
been removed from the object store.

### Scheduler Extender

The Azure Disk CSI Driver V2 scheduler extender influences pod placement by prioritizing healthy nodes where 
attachment replicas for the required persistent volume(s) already exist (i.e. node(s) to which 
the managed disk(s) is(are) already attached). It relies on the `AzVolumeAttachment` instances 
to determine which nodes have attachment replicas, and the heartbeat information in the 
`AzDriverNode` to determine health. If no attachment replicas for the specified persistent 
volume currently exist, the scheduler extender will weight all nodes equally.

### Provisioner Library

The Provisioner Library is a common library to abstract the underlying platform for all 
Azure Disk CSI Driver V2 plugins, services and controllers. It handles the platform-specific details of 
performing volume operations such as (but not necessarily limited to) create, delete, attach, 
detach, snapshot, stage, unstage, mount, unmount, etc.
