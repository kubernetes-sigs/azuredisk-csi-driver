                    description: "NodeName is a type that holds a api.Node's Name
                      identifier. Being a type captures intent and helps make sure
                      that the node name is not confused with similar concepts (the
                      hostname, the cloud provider id, the cloud provider name etc)
                      \n To clarify the various types: \n * Node.Name is the Name
                      field of the Node in the API.  This should be stored in a NodeName.
                      \  Unfortunately, because Name is part of ObjectMeta, we can't
                      store it as a NodeName at the API level. \n * Hostname is the
                      hostname of the local machine (from uname -n).   However, some
                      components allow the user to pass in a --hostname-override flag,
                      \  which will override this in most places. In the absence of
                      anything more meaningful,   kubelet will use Hostname as the
                      Node.Name when it creates the Node. \n * The cloudproviders
                      have the own names: GCE has InstanceName, AWS has InstanceId.
                      \n   For GCE, InstanceName is the Name of an Instance object
                      in the GCE API.  On GCE, Instance.Name becomes the   Hostname,
                      and thus it makes sense also to use it as the Node.Name.  But
                      that is GCE specific, and it is up   to the cloudprovider how
                      to do this mapping. \n   For AWS, the InstanceID is not yet
                      suitable for use as a Node.Name, so we actually use the   PrivateDnsName
                      for the Node.Name.  And this is _not_ always the same as the
                      hostname: if   we are using a custom DHCP domain it won't be."
